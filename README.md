# README.md

This repo, reqp, should help me get and then serve prices.

This repo works well on Ubuntu 16.04.

Steps to install this repo are listed below:

* Boot a copy of Ubuntu 16.04.

* A VirtualBox image of Ubuntu 16.04 which should work well:

* https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx3iDDAtxxI4MmNNLXM4RTZvYTA

* I should boot the above instance and login as ann with password: 'a'

* I should issue a shell commands to create Linux account: 'reqp':

```
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo reqp
sudo passwd reqp
```

* I should login as reqp

```
su -l reqp
```

* I should install Anaconda with shell commands:

```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
echo 'export PATH=${HOME}/anaconda3/bin:$PATH' >> ~reqp/.bashrc
bash
```

* I should clone the reqp repo:

```
cd ~reqp
git clone https://github.com/danbikle/reqp
```

* I should get prices:

```
cd ~reqp/reqp
bin/reqp.bash
```

* I should serve the prices:

```
cd ~reqp/reqp
./fflask.bash
```

* Above command should start a server which then 'locks' my shell.

* I should leave that shell alone and open another shell:

```
curl localhost:5047/static/csv/history/FB.csv > /tmp/FB.csv
```

* I should install heroku CLI:

```
cd ~reqp/
wget https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-cli/channels/stable/heroku-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz -O heroku.tar.gz
tar -xvzf heroku.tar.gz
ln -s heroku-cli*linux-x64 heroku
echo 'export PATH=${HOME}/heroku/bin:$PATH' >> ~reqp/.bashrc
```

* I should deploy reqp to heroku

```
cd ~reqp/reqp
heroku create
git push heroku master
```

* I did the above steps on my laptop and now you can get some prices from my server on heroku:

```
curl https://reqp.herokuapp.com/static/csv/history/FB.csv > /tmp/FB.dan.csv
head /tmp/FB.dan.csv
```
